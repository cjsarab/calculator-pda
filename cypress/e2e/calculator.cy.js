// Do the number buttons update the display of the running total?
// Do the arithmetical operations update the display with the result of the operation?
// Can multiple operations be chained together?
// Is the output as expected for a range of numbers (for example, positive, negative, decimals and very large numbers)?
// What does the code do in exceptional circumstances? 
// Specifically, if you divide by zero, what is the effect? 
// Write a test to describe what you'd prefer to happen, 
// and then correct the code to make that test pass 
// (you will need to modify the Calculator model to meet this requirement).
